Purva is a final year Engineering student from Pune.
She is interested in all things that can be coded and is exploring Machine Learning and Web Development.
Currently decision trees in-tree-gue her and she hopes to do wonderful things with them. She has worked a little with Django(not the movie) and is now figuring out things she can do with React(she is probably console-ing a bug right now).
In her "gadget free" time you will probably find her painting.
You can connect with her through her [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/purva-bhalekar-03432918b/) because she would love to know what you've been working on too!
