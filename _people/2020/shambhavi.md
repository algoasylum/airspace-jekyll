In the perennial journey of learning and self-creation.

Shambhavi has always had a keen interest in technology and solving logical and analytical problems which led her towards choosing Engineering for her Bachelor’s. She is an Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering undergrad who is currently working on the [Air Pollution Monitoring Project](https://github.com/algoasylum/PollutionMonitoringKit_InitialSetupPackage) at AlgoAsylum. Her fields of interest are Electronics, IOT and Cloud Computing.

Creativity, simplicity, networking and integrity are the words she lives by. On weekends or during her summer breaks or when she is procrastinating, you can find her re-watching her favourite series, baking, eating (calls herself a “foodie” even though she is mostly a vegetarian) and sometimes painting.

She’s always up to solve brain teasers. So, if you have a puzzle or just want to know more about her you can connect with her on her [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shambhavi-deshpande-629a75187/).
