Shrirang has dabbled in a number of different areas from VLSI Design Automation
to High Performance Computing to Digitalization. The common thread in all of
these has been algorithms and mathematics. He was employed (for far too many
years) at Intel, IBM Research, Computational Research Labs and Shell, until
finally realizing that it was time to do what he likes doing best -- teaching!
He has founded AlgoAsylum as a platform for students to do interesting work and 
generate new ideas. And to have fun!

In his past life, Shrirang has gotten a PhD, memorized the first thousand
digits of pi and e, served as a pujari, represented his country in a world
championship and gotten into trouble with the law for smuggling. This probably
sounds more interesting than it actually is. And exactly one of the statements
in this paragraph is false.

His website is at https://shrirang.karandikar.org. He enjoys reading (two good 
recommendations - The Three Marriages: Reimagining Work, Self and Relationship,
by David Whyte and The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, by Thomas Kuhn), 
music (Air on the G string, Bach, Egmont Overture, Beethoven and Concerto for Oboe 
and Violin in  D Minor, Bach) and poetry (All You Who Sleep Tonight, by Vikram Seth, 
One Art, by Elizabeth Bishop and anyone lived in a pretty how town, by e e cummings)
