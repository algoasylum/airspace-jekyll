Shrirang has dabbled in a number of different areas from VLSI Design Automation
to High Performance Computing to Digitalization. The common thread in all of
these has been algorithms and mathematics. He was employed (for far too many
years) at Intel, IBM Research, Computational Research Labs and Shell, until
finally realizing that it was time to do what he likes doing best -- teaching!

He founded AlgoAsylum as a platform for students to work on interesting projects. And to have fun!
