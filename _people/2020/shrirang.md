Shrirang has dabbled in a number of different areas from VLSI Design Automation
to High Performance Computing to Digitalization. The common thread in all of
these has been algorithms and mathematics. He was employed (for far too many
years) at Intel, IBM Research, Computational Research Labs and Shell, until
finally realizing that it was time to do what he likes doing best -- teaching!

In his past life, Shrirang has gotten a PhD, served as a pujari, represented
his country in a world championship and gotten into trouble with the law for
smuggling. This probably sounds more interesting than it actually is. And
exactly one of the statements in this paragraph is false.

He founded AlgoAsylum as a platform for students to work on interesting projects. And to have fun!
