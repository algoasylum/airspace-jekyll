Siddharth is a final-year undergraduate student in Computer Science and Engineering at MIT-WPU, Pune. He loves talking about quantum mechanics at family events and about philosophy in science classrooms -- as a result, everyone hates him. Broadly, his fundamental research interests revolve around meta-learning, causal inference, some physics, and understanding the impact of data-driven algorithms on all of us. His work (including [satellite image analysis](https://github.com/algoasylum/SatelliteImageAnalysis/)) also attempts to use machine learning and statistical techniques for social good and accelerate discoveries in other scientific domains.

 In his spare time, he's usually reading -- [his book recommendations](https://www.sidsrivastava.me/bookshelf) (The Demon Haunted World by Carl Sagan is his favourite recommendation), writing -- [his slightly whimsical blog](https://www.sidsrivastava.me/blog), or [playing the guitar](www.sidsrivastava.me/personal). Every now and then, Siddharth finds some [questions](www.sidsrivastava.me) that he thinks about often. In general, he spends a lot of time thinking about education, meta-science, and our civilization's technological future. 

Siddharth's grand plan is to deliver his first sermon at Sarnath, find a nice seat under a beautiful tree at Bodh Gaya, and garner a following to start his own religion after attaining enlightenment under said tree.
