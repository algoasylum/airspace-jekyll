I am a final year Electronics and Telecommunications student from Pune. I am working on the [Air Pollution Monitoring project](https://github.com/algoasylum/PollutionMonitoringKit_InitialSetupPackage). I am also a part of the team that made the first version of this website in 2020. Connect with me about any of my projects through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janhavi-sathe/) and don't forget to introduce yourself! :D

My current areas of interest include Statistical Modelling, IOT and Programming Languages, but curiosity is my middle name and you're likely to find me interested and chasing something new every few months. 

My top 3 things to learn (that are unrelated to work/studies): Psychology, Art History, Piano

In my free time, I love to indulge in stories through any media- films & shows, books, podcasts, talkative friends. 
Occasionally, I write about things on [Medium](https://medium.com/@janhavi.sathe).
